"In a series of experiments, evaluators were presented with profiles of fictional job candidates and asked to rank them according to who was most qualified for an assistant professorship in biology, engineering, economics and psychology. In nearly every case, the female candidates were more likely to be ranked higher, regardless of their lifestyle, area of expertise and the evaluatorsâ€™ field of research. The one exception was with male economists, who showed no gender bias one way or the other." - Sarah Kaplan, Washington Post
